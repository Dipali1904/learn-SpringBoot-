# JPA, Hibernate, Entity & Repository in Spring Boot

## What is Database?

Database is used to:
- Store data permanently
- Retrieve data when needed
- Update and delete data

Example:
- Employee data is stored in database table.

---

## What is ORM?

ORM = Object Relational Mapping

It means:
> Java Class ↔ Database Table

Example:
- Java class `Employee` ↔ Table `employee`

So instead of writing SQL, we work with Java objects.

---

## What is JPA?

JPA = Java Persistence API

- JPA is a **standard** (rules) for working with databases in Java
- It does NOT do the actual work
- It only defines **how** the work should be done

---

## What is Hibernate?

Hibernate is:
- An **implementation of JPA**
- It does the actual database work
- Spring Boot uses Hibernate internally

In simple words:
> JPA = rules  
> Hibernate = worker  

---

## What is @Entity?
`@Entity` tells Spring:
> This Java class should be stored in database as a table.

## Example:

@Entity
public class Employee {
    private Long id;
    private String name;
    private String email;
}

## What is @Id?

@Id means:
This field is the Primary Key of table.

@Id
private Long id;

## What is @GeneratedValue?

@GeneratedValue means:
Database will automatically generate the ID.

@Id
@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
private Long id;

So you do NOT need to send ID manually.

## What is Repository?

Repository is:
-> A Java interface
-> Used to talk to database
-> Spring automatically creates its implementation

## What is JpaRepository?

JpaRepository is a ready-made interface which gives methods like:
save()
findAll()
findById()
deleteById()

Example:
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
}

## How Data is Saved?
repository.save(employee);
Hibernate will convert Java object → SQL → store in DB.

## How Data is Read?
repository.findAll();
repository.findById(id);

## H2 Database (In-Memory)

-> H2 is a simple database
-> Data is deleted when app stops
-> Good for learning and testing

## Automatic Table Creation

This property:
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

Means:
Hibernate will automatically create/update tables.

## Full Flow
Controller → Service → Repository → Hibernate → Database

## Why JPA + Hibernate is Powerful?

-> No SQL needed
-> Less code
-> Faster development
-> Clean and readable code

Summary
JPA is a standard for database operations. Hibernate is its implementation.
@Entity maps Java class to table. Repository is used to perform database operations using JpaRepository.
