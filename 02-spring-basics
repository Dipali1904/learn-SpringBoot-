# Spring Boot Basics

## What is Spring?

Spring is a Java framework that helps us build:
- Web applications
- Enterprise applications
- Microservices

It provides:
- Dependency Injection
- Easy configuration
- Many ready-made features

## What is Spring Boot?

Spring Boot is built on top of Spring.

Spring Boot:
- Makes Spring **easy to use**
- Removes a lot of configuration
- Gives ready-to-use project setup
- Has embedded server (Tomcat)

## Why Spring Boot is Popular?

- No XML configuration
- Auto configuration
- Embedded server
- Easy to create REST APIs
- Production-ready features

## What is a Spring Boot Project?

A Spring Boot project is a normal Java project that:
- Has a main class
- Starts a web server
- Runs like a normal Java program

## What Happens When We Run a Spring Boot App?

1. main() method starts
2. Spring Boot starts the server (Tomcat)
3. Spring creates all objects (beans)
4. Application waits for requests

## Basic Request Flow

Browser → Controller → Service → (Repository) → Response
