# Service Layer & Dependency Injection in Spring Boot

## What is Service Layer?

Service layer is the part of application where:
- Business logic is written
- Actual work is done (calculations, saving data, updating data, etc.)
- Controller calls Service
- Service calls Repository

In simple words:
> Controller = handles request  
> Service = does the real work  

---

## Why Do We Need Service Layer?

We use Service layer because:

- Keeps Controller clean
- Follows proper project structure
- Makes code reusable
- Makes application easy to maintain and test

Without Service:
- Controller becomes very big
- Code becomes messy
- Hard to manage in big projects

## Example of Service Interface

public interface EmployeeService {

    Employee createEmployee(Employee employee);

    List<Employee> getAllEmployees();

    Employee getEmployeeById(Long id);
}

## Example of Service Implementation
@Service
public class EmployeeServiceImpl implements EmployeeService {

    private final EmployeeRepository repository;

    public EmployeeServiceImpl(EmployeeRepository repository) {
        this.repository = repository;
    }

    @Override
    public Employee createEmployee(Employee employee) {
        return repository.save(employee);
    }
}

## What is @Service?

@Service tells Spring:
This class contains business logic and should be managed by Spring.

Spring will:
Create object of this class automatically
Store it in memory
Give it to Controller when needed

## What is Dependency Injection (DI)?

Dependency Injection means:
Spring creates objects for us and gives them when we need them.

We do NOT use:
new EmployeeServiceImpl()
Spring does it automatically.

## Constructor Injection (Best Practice)
private final EmployeeService employeeService;

public EmployeeController(EmployeeService employeeService) {
    this.employeeService = employeeService;
}

This means:
Spring gives the object of EmployeeService automatically
We do not create it manually

## Why "private final"?
private final EmployeeService employeeService;

-> private → cannot be changed from outside
-> final → cannot be changed after constructor
-> Makes code safe and clean

## Flow of Call
Browser / Postman
        ↓
    Controller
        ↓
     Service
        ↓
   Repository
        ↓
    Database

## Why We Do NOT Write Logic in Controller?

Because:
Controller should only handle HTTP
Service should handle business logic
This makes code clean and professional
