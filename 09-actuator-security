## Spring Boot Actuator

What is Actuator?
Spring Boot Actuator provides production-ready endpoints to monitor the application.

It tells:
Is app running?
Is DB connected?
Health status
Memory, CPU, metrics

## Why Actuator is used?

In real projects:
-> DevOps & developers need to check app health
-> To monitor application without logging into server

## Example Endpoints
/actuator/health
/actuator/info
/actuator/metrics

## How to enable Actuator?

Add dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>

## In application.properties:
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info

## Test
Open:
http://localhost:8080/actuator/health

Response:
{
  "status": "UP"
}

## Spring Security

What is Spring Security?
Spring Security is used to secure APIs using login & password.

## Why we need Security?

Without security:
Anyone can access APIs
Anyone can delete or update data

With security:
Only authorized users can access APIs

## How to enable Security?

Add dependency:
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>

Restart app.

Now:
All APIs are protected
Browser asks for login

## Default Credentials
Username: user
Password: shown in console

## Set your own credentials

In application.properties:
spring.security.user.name=admin
spring.security.user.password=admin123

## Important Concepts
Authentication : Authentication means verifying username and password.

Authorization : Authorization means checking what user is allowed to do.
