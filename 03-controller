# Controllers in Spring Boot

## What is a Controller?

A Controller is a Java class that:
- Receives HTTP requests from browser
- Decides what to do with the request
- Returns a response

## What is @RestController?

@RestController tells Spring:
- This class will handle web requests
- The return value should be sent directly as response

## What is @GetMapping?

@GetMapping is used to:
- Map a URL to a Java method
- Example:
  /hello → hello() method

## Example Flow

1. User opens browser
2. User hits URL:
   http://localhost:8080/hello
3. Spring finds matching controller method
4. That method runs
5. Return value is sent to browser

## Why Controllers are Needed?

- They connect the outside world (HTTP) to our Java code
- They are entry point of the application

## Example:

@RestController
public class TestController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String hello() {
        return "Hello Spring Boot";
    }
}
