## 1. DTO (Data Transfer Object)

What is DTO?
DTO is a simple Java class used to transfer data between layers.
We do NOT expose Entity directly to the client.
DTO is used to transfer data between layers and avoid exposing entities directly.

## Why DTO is needed?

To hide internal database structure
To control what data goes to client
To improve security
To avoid sending unnecessary fields

## Example
❌ Entity (Internal)
Employee {
   id
   name
   email
}

✅ DTO (What client sees)
EmployeeDTO {
   id
   name
}

## Conversion Logic
private EmployeeDTO convertToDTO(Employee emp) {
    EmployeeDTO dto = new EmployeeDTO();
    dto.setId(emp.getId());
    dto.setName(emp.getName());
    return dto;
}

## Where we used DTO?

In getAllEmployees()
In pagination API
To return clean response to client

## 2. Pagination

-> To improve performance when large data exists.
-> Pagination means getting data page by page instead of loading everything at once.

## Why Pagination?
If database has:
    1,00,000 records

Loading all at once will:
❌ Slow server
❌ Crash UI
❌ Waste memory

## Example API
GET /employees/paged?page=0&size=2

This means:
Page = 0
Size = 2 records per page

## Code Concept
PageRequest.of(page, size)

## Benefits: 
Faster API
Better performance
Used in ALL real-world projects

## 3. Swagger (API Documentation)

## What is Swagger?
-> Swagger is used for API documentation and testing.
-> Swagger is a tool that automatically generates API documentation and provides a UI to:
    See all APIs
    Test APIs
    See request/response format

## How to open Swagger?

Open in browser:
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html

## What can we do in Swagger?

Test GET, POST, PUT, DELETE APIs
See JSON format
See API responses
No need Postman

## Why Swagger is used in companies?

Backend + Frontend + QA use same documentation
No need to explain APIs manually
Always up-to-date
Acts as API contract

Example: Create Employee
Request:
{
  "name": "Dipali",
  "email": "dipali@gmail.com"
}

Response:
{
  "id": 3,
  "name": "Dipali",
  "email": "dipali@gmail.com"
}
